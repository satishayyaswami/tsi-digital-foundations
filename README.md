## TSI Digital Foundations

Digital technologies have profoundly changed the ways we do business, buy, work and live. They have even altered society and continue impacting virtually all business functions and industries.

India started as an outsourcing destination in the 1990s and quickly received global prominence for the back office work. Though the outsourcing market is not growing very fast these days, with the proliferation of mobile phones and with the costs of smartphones & internet coming down steeply, India itself is at the cusp of becoming a very large market for Digital Technologies with its 500 million consumer base. No wonder services such as app based shopping, classifieds, taxi booking etc. are mushrooming in this country like never before. Besides with the rise of social media platforms, even the traditional brick-and-mortar businesses have no other choice except to embrace digital technologies to engage their prospects and customers. And traditional roles such as sales & marketing, teaching, accounting etc. are also changing because of digital technologies. There is also a heavy push from the government with its initiatives such as Digital India, Make-in-India and Smart Cities. Overall, this is excellent news for an aspirant who is planning to start his / her career in the digital technologies space.

The question is where to begin? When there are myriads of job opportunities and job profiles out there under digital technologies, how does an aspirant find and land on an opportunity that suits him / her? This is the problem we have set out to solve via our TSI Digital Foundations Program.

Inspired by Montessori training methodology, we start with a Foundations Course and lead the aspirant towards a Job Suitability & Aptitude Assessment. We, then, expose the aspirant to Advanced Topics and guide him / her through a self-directed learning program on the chosen career path using On-the-Job training methods. When the aspirant demonstrates sufficient proficiency in performing the role, we will proactively work with the candidate along with our employer partner in finding a suitable role.

The purpose of the Digital Foundations course is to provide a quick peek into the current state of digital technologies. This course is targeted at aspirants who have completed / completing their Bachelor's Degree. It assumes that the aspirants possess requisite verbal, quantitative and analytical skills but very little computer skills.

How is it different?

TSI Digital Foundations program does not offer conventional instructor led pedagogy. The emphasis is on self - directed learning assisted by a coach/ mentor. The coach and the aspirant jointly designs a personalized program that is suited to the aspirant's needs. The aspirants work in small groups, which resemble a job - like environment, and accomplish tasks collectively. The aspirant's progress will be obsessively tracked on a system with inputs from all stakeholders who are interacting with the aspirant from time to time. A qualitative “Skill Report” that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the aspirant will be shared with hiring managers.
